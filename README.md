# DOMINATING-FOLDING
Let us define the DOMINATING FOLDING of a string of length n as the folding of a string from the middle such that the bigger (by ASCII value) of the characters at the indices i and (n􀀀i) are retained. If the folding happens from the left or right, the bigger of ith and (n 􀀀 i)th characters are retained at the end or beginning, respectively. Note that the DOMINATING FOLDING will turn the string into half of its length except for the cases where the length of the string is 1. Write a program that takes a string and a series of folding instructions and returns the result.
